[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wiseman/clj-xio.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wiseman/clj-xio)

Extra IO functions for Clojure.

`copy`

Like `core/copy` but supports the `:callback` option.

`slurp`

Like `core/slurp` but is buffered and supports the `:callback` option.
2.9x faster than `core/slurp` when reading a 100 KB file, 3.4x faster
when reading a 1 MB file.

`spit`

Like `core/spit` but is buffered and supports the `:callback` option.


`binary-slurp`

`binary-spit`


| `copy`         | Like `core/split` but Supports :callback. |
| `slurp`        |
| `spit`         |
| `binary-slurp` |
| `binary-spit`  |


.  Optimized `copy`, `slurp`, `spit`, `binary-slurp`
and `binary-spit`.  Each supports a `:callback` option.
